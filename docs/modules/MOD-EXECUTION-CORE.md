# MOD-EXECUTION-CORE — execution core

This document is the detailed source-development, integration and qualification contract for `MOD-EXECUTION-CORE`. The machine authority remains `docs/machine/module-catalog.v1.json`; this document explains how engineers must implement and operate that contract without widening its evidence ceiling.

## 1. Identity and maturity

- Module ID: `MOD-EXECUTION-CORE`
- Module version: `1.0.0`
- Name: **execution core**
- Plane: `execution`
- Primary owner: `team-execution-core`
- Backup owner: `team-runtime`
- Maturity: `L1_SOURCE`
- Catalog authority: `docs/machine/module-catalog.v1.json`
- Documentation index: `docs/machine/module-document-index.v1.json`
- Resource provenance: `docs/machine/resource-budget-provenance.v1.json`
- Evidence ceiling: **SOURCE_ONLY_UNTIL_EXACT_HEAD_CI**.

Source ownership paths:

- `apps/trillionnium-owner-open-host/src/bin/r5_control_host_v7`

The maturity value is a source-state label, not an installed-target or release assertion. A later evidence package must bind the exact source, build, target and reviewer identities before a higher level is claimed.

## 2. Responsibilities

The module has these stable responsibilities:

- turn, call and job routing.

Operationally, the required flow is:

The host receives a validated execution request, binds it to turn, call and job identities, records the accepted transition, routes the exact provider-selected operation to the appropriate runtime, and publishes bounded observations back to the turn engine.

Every accepted transition must carry enough identity to correlate input, state mutation, output and terminal classification. Capacity is reserved before a slow or externally visible operation begins.

## 3. Non-goals and authority boundary

Explicit non-goals:

- plan reconstruction.

The host is the composition root but not a semantic principal. It must not reconstruct a plan, choose an alternative tool, sanitize a command into a different command, automatically compensate, or continue after authority or identity becomes ambiguous.

The provider remains the sole semantic principal. This module may reject malformed, unauthenticated, stale, over-budget or unsafe mechanical input, but it must not invent goals, choose a substitute operation, hide an uncertain effect or widen authority during recovery.

## 4. Context, dependencies and data flow

Direct dependencies: `MOD-PROTOCOL`, `MOD-TURN-ENGINE`, `MOD-JOB-RUNTIME`, `MOD-EVENT-STORE`.

The normal data-flow boundary is: validate the versioned input; bind identity and ordering metadata; reserve finite capacity; make the minimal authoritative transition; execute or forward the exact mechanical action; retain bounded observations; publish one terminal or explicit unknown classification.

Dependencies are consumed through their declared APIs. A dependency outage cannot be converted into success. Cycles are prohibited by the machine catalog, and slow external work remains outside broad registry or global-control locks.

## 5. API and protocol contract

- API schema: `org.trillionnium.mod_execution_core.api.v1`
- Input wire types: `execution_request_v1`
- Output wire types: `execution_event_v1`
- Error wire types: `execution_error_v1`
- Unknown fields: rejected unless a future compatibility revision explicitly changes the rule.
- Versioning: semantic version `1.0.0`; incompatible changes require a new version and migration evidence.
- Size and count limits: bounded by the resource contract and validated before allocation or durable mutation.

Each request must include its version, request identity, ordering identity and payload digest where applicable. Responses preserve the same correlation identity. Duplicate requests with identical identity and digest are idempotent only where the module contract declares an existing result; identity reuse with different content is an explicit conflict.

## 6. State model and ownership

- State schema: `org.trillionnium.mod_execution_core.state.v1`
- State authority: **authoritative**
- Partition key: `turn_stream_id`
- State owned: `host correlation state`
- Durability class: `journaled`
- Retention ceiling: 4096 items and 67108864 bytes per declared bounded in-memory window.
- Terminal vocabulary: `closed` and `unknown`; implementation-specific intermediate states must converge to one of those classifications or a versioned extension.

Only this module may perform authoritative writes for its state families. Read models may be rebuilt from retained authoritative records but cannot become an alternate writer. Every writer carries a module or service epoch; stale epochs fail closed.

## 7. Ordering, concurrency and backpressure

- Ordering key: `turn_stream_id`
- Maximum declared concurrency: `64`
- Admission resource: `resource_contract.queue_items`
- Lease source: `local_bounded_budget`
- Lock scope: `module-local per-key metadata guard`
- Backpressure: `reject_at_capacity`
- Timeout ceiling: `30000` milliseconds
- Lease expiry: `stop_new_admission_and_fence_authoritative_writes`
- Duplicate/conflict rule: `idempotent_duplicate_or_explicit_conflict`

Per-key operations are linearized while unrelated keys may progress concurrently. Process spawn, external I/O, fsync and provider waits are slow paths and must not execute under a global registry lock. At capacity, admission is rejected before starting a process or publishing an accepted effect.

## 8. Effect, cancellation and uncertainty semantics

Automatic redispatch: **forbidden**.

Cancellation is targeted by exact request, call, job, turn, connection or module identity as appropriate. Cancellation requests and terminal completion races are serialized through the authoritative lifecycle transition. Cleanup frees resources but does not authorize a replacement effect.

An accepted operation lacking authoritative terminal evidence is `unknown` or reconciliation-required. A timeout, disconnect, restart, missing journal entry or process-leader exit is not proof that an external effect did not occur.

## 9. Resource budget and SLO status

Resource budget authority: `docs/machine/resource-budget-provenance.v1.json`.

| Contract item | Current source ceiling |
|---|---:|
| CPU weight | 100 |
| Memory | 67108864 bytes |
| File descriptors | 256 |
| Processes | 16 |
| Threads | 64 |
| I/O rate | 10485760 bytes/s |
| Queue items | 4096 |
| Queue bytes | 67108864 |
| Store bytes | 536870912 |
| Operation timeout | 30000 ms |
| Recovery target | 60000 ms |
| Provisional P99 target | 1000 ms |
| Provisional throughput target | 100/s |
| Provisional availability target | 99.0% |

Measurement status: **unmeasured until qualified evidence**.

These values are finite source-admission ceilings and provisional objectives, not benchmark results. They remain observe-only until workload profiles `WL-01` through `WL-12`, environment identity, samples, percentiles and resource observations are retained in a qualifying L2 package.

## 10. Persistence, recovery and reconciliation

The next host epoch replays durable correlation records, fences stale writers, reconnects only to explicitly recoverable mechanical state and leaves uncertain effects in unknown/reconciliation-required state.

Durable writes use an explicit commit boundary. Startup validates schema, epoch and record integrity before admission. Corrupt or incompatible authoritative state is quarantined or causes fail-closed startup. Reconciliation observes external reality first; it never fills a missing record by blind effect replay.

## 11. Security and trust boundaries

The host is the composition root but not a semantic principal. It must not reconstruct a plan, choose an alternative tool, sanitize a command into a different command, automatically compensate, or continue after authority or identity becomes ambiguous.

Peer identity, process identity, executable or artifact digest, epoch, namespace and target identity are retained where relevant. Secrets and command content are redacted by default. Emergency inhibit is independent of provider health and prevents new admission without fabricating terminal outcomes.

## 12. Failure matrix and degraded behavior

| Failure | Required classification | Required behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Invalid or unsupported input | rejected-before-accept | no state mutation and no external start |
| Capacity exhausted | rejected-at-admission | no spawn, forward or durable accepted record |
| Timeout or disconnect before terminal proof | unknown/reconciliation-required | stop blind progress; preserve exact identity |
| Process or dependency exit | explicit failure or unknown | converge descendants and fence the epoch |
| Storage I/O or fsync ambiguity | degraded/fail-closed | stop authoritative writes; retain ambiguity |
| Corrupt state | quarantined or fail-closed | no automatic replay |
| Stale writer or lease | fenced | reject the write and emit an audit observation |
| Duplicate identity with changed content | conflict | never deliver the old terminal as the new result |

The degraded state is `fail_closed`. Recovery is `reconcile_before_resume`, and uncertain effects remain `no_automatic_redispatch`.

## 13. Compatibility, migration and rollback

Rolling compatibility is supported under the explicit compatibility and fencing contract. Read/write compatibility currently accepts `v1` and writes `v1` unless the module-specific migration below states otherwise.

The v1 execution core drains and fences old host epochs before a replacement starts; no implicit state reinterpretation is permitted.

Rollback is fail-closed. Stateful modules restore the last compatible durable state, fence newer writers and reconcile external effects before admission. A rollback may restore software and state compatibility; it cannot erase an effect already attempted outside the module.

## 14. Observability

Correlate every accepted transition using turn, call, job, request digest and host epoch. Record routing latency, queue depth, duplicate/conflict outcomes and terminal ownership without logging sensitive bodies.

Every metric and log record is bounded and versioned. Required common dimensions are module ID, instance or service epoch, ordering-key digest, operation class and outcome. High-cardinality raw identifiers are hashed or retained only in access-controlled evidence. Readiness means the module can safely admit work; liveness alone is insufficient.

## 15. Verification and evidence

Minimum evidence level declared by the catalog: `L1`.

Source qualification must include unit, concurrency, migration and negative tests, exact clean checkout identity, generated-document verification and immutable artifact digests. Higher-level claims require separate installed-target, Android graph, physical-device, destructive-fault or release packages.

Evidence ceiling: **SOURCE_ONLY_UNTIL_EXACT_HEAD_CI**.

The module documentation verifier checks this document against the machine catalog, verifies required sections and source paths, binds the API and state schema identifiers, checks the provisional budget record and rejects unregistered or misleading documentation.

## 16. Deployment and runbook

On routing divergence, inhibit admission, capture the host epoch and durable correlation snapshot, compare exact request digests across provider, broker and runtime, then reconcile before restart.

Standard deployment sequence:

1. Bind the exact source and dependency graph.
2. Validate configuration, identity, finite budgets and migration compatibility.
3. Start in inhibited or observe-only state.
4. Recover and reconcile authoritative state.
5. Prove readiness before enabling admission.
6. Drain, fence and retain terminal observations during shutdown.
7. Preserve the exact evidence subject for every promotion decision.

## 17. Open gaps and exit criteria

Open machine gaps: `GAP-PRODUCT-ENTRYPOINT-001`, `GAP-CONC-REGISTRY-001`.

### GAP-PRODUCT-ENTRYPOINT-001 — exit L3

One install manifest selects the product entrypoint and internal children.

Exit evidence must demonstrate:
- source entrypoint is unambiguous.
- target-files contain the exact selected binaries.
- foundation stubs are absent from product inventory.

### GAP-CONC-REGISTRY-001 — exit L2

Call and job registries shard without weakening per-key ordering.

Exit evidence must demonstrate:
- stable shard function.
- per-key linearity.
- bounded capacity.
- contention benchmark.

A source change may reduce implementation risk, but the status stays open or source-closed-pending-evidence until an immutable, current, independently authorized receipt reaches the declared exit level.
